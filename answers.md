1. loc1.getRow()
2. false
3. 4,4
4. southeast
5. the getLocation() method will return the values given but altered to be further south/north or east/west or both

1. run getNeighbors on every space and add up all values returned, run getEmptyAdjacentLocations on every space and do the same.
2. run getValidAdjacentLocations in the bottoms right corner, if both the x and y coordinates are more than or equal to ten, the coordinates 10,10 is within the grid.
3. Grid inherits the code from other files because it is an interface for the different classes. The implementation could be found in the file running the interface.
4. An arraylist should be used because the length of the array isn't known at the beginning, the methods return a varying amount of values so the array length couldn't be known.

1. color direction location
2. whatever was specified when the method to create the actor was called.
3. So this specific kind of actor can be defined rather than all actors.
4. An error occurs. The actor itself is made up of information about itself. If I try to give it two values where there is only one, the bug would have to become two different actors which the code doesn't allow.
5. turn twice?
