1. gives the length of each side of the square that the bug is going to follow.
2. steps tells the program how much the bug has moved and if it is still within it's box.
3. turn causes the bug to turn 45 degrees and when the bug reaches the side of its box it must turn 90 degrees thus the turn method is called twice when the bug meets the side of the box
4. inherits the method from the jar file.
5. The boxbug's square will always be different because the side-length can be changed by the interface.
6. Yes if the bug collides with a wall or another bug it will turn.
7. The number of steps will only be zero at the beginning of the code, before anything has moved.

exercises. The bug makes 2 circles overlapped like a venn diagram.
